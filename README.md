# Goals
### Number of simultaneous monitoring agents
* Total number of mobile/fixed monitoring agents that can be controlled and scheduled per second (10 or more)

# Assignment
* Information analysis system design/implementation
* Multi-modal monitoring data management (MAMS - Multi-Agent Monitoring System)
* Outdoor abnormal situation DB purification/tagging

# Information on our Dataset 
The dataset was collected using a cloud-based surveillance
system at Pohang and Gwangju in South Korea between
April 2017 and August 2021. The system was composed of
mobile robots, fixed sensor modules, and a cloud system for
outdoor surveillance.
* Environments

A robot patrols around the building, and fixed cameras
are installed at the borders of the building and significant
points to collect the multi-modal sensor dataset for
surveillance tasks. Therefore, we selected two big sites for
operating our surveillance robots. The
robot moved along the pavement around the buildings under
various weather conditions including rainy and foggy days.
Walker, cyclists, and cars pass by the mobile robots and fixed
multi-modal sensor module. While the mobile robot patrols,
humans, cyclists, and cars are observed.

* Multi-Modal Sensor Module

Our sensor module includes five different sensors. For the detailed information on the sensor
configuration, calibration, and synchronization, please refer
to our previous work. (T. Uhm, J. Park, J. Lee, G. Bae, G. Ki, and Y. Choi, “Design of
multimodal sensor module for outdoor robot surveillance system,”
Electronics, vol. 11, no. 14, p. 2214, 2022.)

* Information on Actors 

We also used professional actors to provide various
scenarios and realistic actions for our dataset. We hired two female and two male actors. The age of the actors is 20∼30. All
actors are Korean. The average height of female actors is about 160 cm. The
average height of male actors is about 175 cm.
